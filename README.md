# snake
implementation of the Nokia snake game, originally made as a hw assignment. Have fun playing!

## How to run:
make sure python is installed. 
Run snake.py with python

Unless using the full Windows installer, sometimes tkinter is not installed to save space. Make sure you install the python tkinter library if you don't already have it.
